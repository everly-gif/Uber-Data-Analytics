# Uber-Data-Analytics

This project focuses on peroforming data analytics on a Uber Drive Dataset to study patterns and trends to better understand any ordinary uber rider.
- The dataset used here is taken from Kaggle.  
- The link can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/uberdrives?select=My+Uber+Drives+-+2016.csv       
  
  
 I was able to analyze the dataset and calculate popluar starting destinations, drop points , proportions and plot graphs such as bars and pie charts from the data sets.
